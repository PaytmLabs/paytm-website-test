text: "Our residents often ask if or when we will accept credit card for taxes and utility payments. With our small Town budget and pressure to keep property taxes low it just doesn’t make sense for us to accept credit cards with their related fees. Paytm allows us to avoid the fees and our residents to pay by credit card – win/win. We are excited to work with Paytm."
