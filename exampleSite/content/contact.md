Located in Toronto, Canada since 2014, Paytmâ€™s mission is to bring better financial services to Canadians. By offering a mobile payment and commerce platform.

In 2017, Paytm launched a consumer-facing mobile application in Canada. The Paytm Canada app allows Canadians to pay all their bills with their smartphone by using their credit card, bank account or Paytm Cash without paying any fees. Customers collect Paytm Points for every transaction made in the App, and they can redeem their Points for Paytm Rewards. In addition to, sending money to friends and family across Canada. Paytm has invested more than $50 million to grow their operations in Canada over the next decade.

As a registered Money Services Business (MSB) regulated by FINTRAC, Paytm Canada offers its customers the ability to pay for utility bills, city tax payments, credit card bills, mobile bills and many more categories from the choice of thousands of Canadian companies on the Paytm Canada network.

The parent company, valued at an estimated worth of $10 billion, provides leading consumer payment solutions accepted by many service providers and merchants in India. For example: Uber and other transportation services, utility providers and both online and in-store retailers.

Though it operates independently within the country, Paytm Canada seeks to create the same value for customers that made its parent company a household name in India.
